This is a live coding demonstaration on my YouTube channel. YouTube channel link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAq-NdBlNrQ
For more upcoming videos, please feel free to subscribe to my channel. Language of Choice is Java and and editor is Android Studio. 

## Motivation
Android Development is the corner stone of my Coding Journey. I created this channel for all those people, who have enough will to step into the unknown and see it for themselves if they really have it in them to push through against the odds. This video has 420 views and 18 likes so far and that's enough motivation for me to continue creating quality content. This is also tributed to my mentors - Dmitry Konovalov, Jason Holdsworth and Vinod Choudhary. Vinod has really gone an extra mile in breaking down complex topics into simpler chunks. He also runs a channel called "Digital Learning" - Link- https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalLearningPythonAndroid/videos )
